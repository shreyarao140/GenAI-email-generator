## Overview

This application streamlines the process of crafting tailored cold emails for job applications. It leverages the power of language models and web scraping to:

2. **Match with Portfolio:** It then compares the extracted skills with your own portfolio of projects and experiences, identifying relevant links to showcase.
3. **Generate Personalized Emails:** Using a large language model, the app generates a professional cold email tailored to the specific job posting, highlighting your skills and relevant experience, and including links to your portfolio.

## Features
